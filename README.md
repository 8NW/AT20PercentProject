## Websight

WebSight is a machine-learning based HTML/website summarizer engine built in Python which makes it possible to feed in a website and create a navigatable format for those who are occularly impaired. 


#### How it Works

Websight utilizes [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/.html)


Create a web app that has at least one database [model](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html). It must meet the following requirements:
 - Have the ability to create new instances of the [model](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html) in the database.
 - Show a useful subset of database entries. (Look into [sorting, filtering, and selecting](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html))
 - Update a database entry. ([Updating an entry](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/documents.html))
 - Style (with CSS) your page(s). ([Static files](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html))

#### Submission

Make sure that your code works the way your group intends, then push your group's repo to Github.
