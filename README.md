## Websight

WebSight is a machine-learning based HTML/website summarizer engine built in Python which makes it possible to feed in a website and create a navigatable format for those who are occularly impaired. 


#### How it Works

Websight utilizes [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to create a machine learning system that takes in a website and identifies all components of the website. After this step it sorts and labels them. Afterwards it reformats the website into a series of arrays based on the header label assigned to the blocks of the website. ONce in the array form, the user can navigate through the newly formatted website type.
